Should contract templates be allowed to be adjusted after they are "live"?
  Probably not, as the old paper contracts weren't able to do this.
  If so, what should happen to contract days that are selected by users that then fall outside of the new contract
  template range?

What contract types are there for faculty and how many days are required for each?
